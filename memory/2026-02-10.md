## System Configuration & Maintenance
- **Sudo Access:** Enabled passwordless sudo for user `ironman` to allow autonomous system maintenance.
- **Disk Management:** Resolved a critical disk space issue (95% full). Freed ~8GB by clearing caches (`~/.cache`, `npm`, `go`) and removing unused Ollama model `llama3:latest`.
- **System Updates:** Established a daily update routine.
    - Script: `~/scripts/daily_update.sh` (runs `apt update/upgrade/autoremove`).
    - Schedule: 03:00 AM via system cron.
    - Monitoring: `HEARTBEAT.md` configured to check logs and report status to Telegram ID `195050411`.

## Crypto Trading Strategies (BTC & ETH)
- **Script Fixes:** Added shebangs and fixed permissions for `btc_strategy_full.py` and `eth_strategy_full.py`.
- **Enhancements (Options 1 & 3):**
    - Integrated `matplotlib` to generate visual candlestick charts with EMA 50/200 and Bollinger Bands.
    - Added AI-powered analysis insights (Trend status, RSI oversold/overbought alerts, MACD momentum).
    - Integrated direct Telegram delivery using the `openclaw message send` CLI to ensure charts are sent as media attachments rather than links.
- **Scheduling:** Staggered cron jobs to avoid resource contention (BTC at :00, ETH at :02).

## Token Optimization
- **Context Limit:** Manually limited the global `contextWindow` for `gemini-3-pro-high` to 100,000 tokens in `openclaw.json` to reduce costs.
- **Compaction:** Verified system is on `safeguard` mode for main chat stability.

## Skills Added
- Installed several professional tools: `trading-coach`, `crypto-price`, `hyperliquid-trading`, `ssh-manager`, `sw-devops`, `dns-networking`, `grafana`.
