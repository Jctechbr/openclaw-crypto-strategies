# Crypto Communication Guidelines

## Emoji Usage for Cryptocurrencies
To maintain consistency across all crypto-related communications, use the following emojis:

- 💰 Bitcoin (BTC/USDT)
- 💎 Ethereum (ETH/USDT)
- ☀️ Solana (SOL/USDT)
- 💧 XRP (XRP/USDT)

## Usage Guidelines
- Use these emojis when referring to cryptocurrencies in:
  - Trading reports and analysis
  - Telegram messages
  - Status updates
  - Strategy communications
- Apply consistently across all agents and communications to ensure brand recognition
- These emojis help quickly identify cryptocurrencies in visual communication

## Implementation
- All crypto trading agents should reference these emojis
- Use in report headers, asset lists, and price notifications
- Maintain consistency with the main crypto trading strategy documentation

## Notes
- BTC uses 💰 (money bag) - represents Bitcoin's value proposition
- ETH uses 💎 (diamond) - represents Ethereum's smart contract capabilities
- SOL uses ☀️ (sun) - represents Solana's speed and brightness
- XRP uses 💧 (water droplet) - represents Ripple's payment network

This standardization ensures consistent visual identification across all crypto communications.
